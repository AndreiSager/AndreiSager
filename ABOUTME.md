## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

- 💞️ I like learning things hands-on, on my own, or with others by building projects—creating, collaborating, and contributing whenever I can.
- ☕ For leisure I enjoy reading books, creative writing, and physical activities. Someday I want to become a novel author alongside being a software engineer.

## 🚀 My Journey

I started my programming journey as a financial management (FM) college student, learning the ropes of money and finance. However, one year in, I realized this path wasn’t for me. Financial management felt unfulfilling, and I found myself questioning my purpose.
Amid that uncertainty, I remembered my lifelong fascination with computers. Inspired by this childhood interest, I decided to shift courses to information technology (IT) to explore something new. What started as testing the waters quickly turned into a passion, leading me to shift once more—this time into computer science (CS).

Many people say a CS degree isn’t necessary to become a software engineer, and I wholeheartedly agree. Yet, for me, those four years were transformative. Along the way, I not only deepened my understanding of programming but also discovered something about myself: that programming, like many meaningful pursuits, requires time, effort, consistency, and above all, persistence. Every roadblock I encountered helped me grow.

During this journey, I found myself drawn to another passion—writing. I started exploring storytelling and even entertained the idea of becoming a novelist. While balancing this newfound interest with my computer science studies was challenging, I don’t regret it. Writing allowed me to immerse myself in the stories others had created and inspired me to craft my own.

This crossroads of programming and writing led me to a unique solution: combining the two passions. I started creating writing software and writing tools as side projects, allowing me to enjoy both worlds simultaneously.

Now, my ultimate goal is clear: to create the best writing software possible, no matter the effort it takes. Although AI tools like ChatGPT have become increasingly common and impressive, I’ll continue to write because I genuinely enjoy the process and the creativity it brings.
