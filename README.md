<details><summary>üöÄ My Programming Journey (‚è© You Can Skip This)</summary>
<br/>
I started my programming journey as a financial management (FM) college student, learning the ropes of money and finance. However, one year in, I realized this path wasn‚Äôt for me. Financial management felt unfulfilling, and I found myself questioning my purpose.

Amid that uncertainty, I remembered my lifelong fascination with computers. Inspired by this childhood interest, I decided to shift courses to information technology (IT) to explore something new. What started as testing the waters quickly turned into a passion, leading me to shift once more‚Äîthis time into computer science (CS).

Many people say a CS degree isn‚Äôt necessary to become a software engineer, and I wholeheartedly agree. Yet, for me, those four years were transformative. Along the way, I not only deepened my understanding of programming but also discovered something about myself: that programming, like many meaningful pursuits, requires time, effort, consistency, and above all, persistence. Every roadblock I encountered helped me grow.

During this journey, I found myself drawn to another passion‚Äîwriting. I started exploring storytelling and even entertained the idea of becoming a novelist. While balancing this newfound interest with my computer science studies was challenging, I don‚Äôt regret it. Writing allowed me to immerse myself in the stories others had created and inspired me to craft my own.

This crossroads of programming and writing led me to a unique solution: combining the two passions. I started creating writing software and writing tools as side projects, allowing me to enjoy both worlds simultaneously.

Now, my ultimate goal is clear: to create the best writing software possible, no matter the effort it takes. Although AI tools like ChatGPT have become increasingly common and impressive, I‚Äôll continue to write because I genuinely enjoy the process and the creativity it brings.
