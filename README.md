  <summary>üëë What Is Lored?</summary>
  <br/>
  Lored is a multi-platform app designed for writers to organize, plot, and write whatever they want. It‚Äôs a project I‚Äôve dreamed of building for a long time‚Äîa place where my skills in programming and creative writing come together. The idea for Lored was born out of my own frustrations with existing writing apps. As I worked on my novel, I kept finding limitations and inefficiencies in the tools I was using. I wanted something that could cater to both the technical and creative sides of writing, and that‚Äôs exactly what Lored is set out to do.

<details><summary>üöÄ My Programming Journey</summary>
<br/>
I started my programming journey as a financial management (FM) college student, learning the ropes of money and finance. However, one year in, I realized this path wasn‚Äôt for me. Financial management felt unfulfilling, and I found myself questioning my purpose.

Amid that uncertainty, I remembered my lifelong fascination with computers. Inspired by this childhood interest, I decided to shift courses to information technology (IT) to explore something new. What started as testing the waters quickly turned into a passion, leading me to shift once more‚Äîthis time into computer science (CS).

Many people say a CS degree isn‚Äôt necessary to become a software engineer, and I wholeheartedly agree. Yet, for me, those four years were transformative. Along the way, I not only deepened my understanding of programming but also discovered something about myself: that programming, like many meaningful pursuits, requires time, effort, consistency, and above all, persistence. Every roadblock I encountered helped me grow.

During this journey, I found myself drawn to another passion‚Äîwriting. I started exploring storytelling and even entertained the idea of becoming a novelist. While balancing this newfound interest with my computer science studies was challenging, I don‚Äôt regret it. Writing allowed me to immerse myself in the stories others had created and inspired me to craft my own.

This crossroads of programming and writing led me to a unique solution: combining the two passions. I started creating writing software and writing tools as side projects, allowing me to enjoy both worlds simultaneously.

Now, my ultimate goal is clear: to create the best writing software possible, no matter the effort it takes. Although AI tools like ChatGPT have become increasingly common and impressive, I‚Äôll continue to write because I genuinely enjoy the process and the creativity it brings.

  Lored is a multi-platform app that writers can use to organize, plot, and write whatever they want. Lored is something I have been wanting to build for a long time. I wanted to combine my skills in programming and creative writing into a single project while addressing my frustrations with the existing apps that I have been using to write my novel.

<!-- My writing has been replaced by A.I.
I started my programming journey as a financial management (FM) college student learning the ropes about money. One year in, I soon came to regret my decision and had the realization this wasn't what I wanted. Financial management was not for me. 

Amid my despair, lost, without a purpose to live, I suddenly remembered that ever since I was a child I had always been interested in computers. With that in mind, I shifted courses into information technology (IT), just to test the waters, but I eventually became more interested in software and shifted my course again into computer science (CS).

Many people say that a CS degree is not necessary to become a software engineer, and I wholeheartedly agree, but graduating from this four-year-long path allowed me to discover many different things about myself and programming that I didn't know. Programming made me understand that things take time, effort, consistency, and most importantly, persistence as I frequently ran into roadblocks. I became interested in not only writing code but also in writing stories. Honestly, pursuing to become a novel author in the middle of a CS degree was a bad choice, but I don't regret it as I enjoyed reading the stories made by others and writing my very own.

Wanting to become a novel writer in the middle of studying for my computer science degree led me to a dilemma on which to pursue. Since programming and writing are pretty much similar, I quickly found a way to enjoy both at the same time by making writing software and writing tools as my side projects. 

Now, my goal is to create the best writing software whatever it takes. Although A.I. is cool I still enjoy writing on my own.
